# This is assignment 4
## REQUIREMENTS 
### You will have to solve two problem statements from the list below, one using the backtracking programming method and one using the dynamic programming method.
### For the backtracking problem, implement both an iterative as well as a recursive algorithm (deadline is week 5).
### For the dynamic programming problem, implement both the naive, non-optimized version as well as the dynamic programming version (deadline is week 6).
### For the dynamic programming implementation, display the data structure used to memorize the intermediate results and be able to explain how it works.
### For all implementations understand and be able to explain the computational complexity with regards to runtime.

## BACKTRACKING 
### Consider a positive number n. Determine all its decompositions as sums of prime numbers.
